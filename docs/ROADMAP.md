## Implementation Notes

### Push Notifications
Service worker (sw.js) already has push/notification handlers. To complete:

1. **Generate VAPID keys** — `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`
2. **Frontend subscription** — Call `pushManager.subscribe()` with VAPID public key when user enables push
3. **Store subscriptions** — Create `push_subscriptions` table in Supabase:
   ```sql
   create table push_subscriptions (
     id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
     user_id uuid references auth.users(id),
     endpoint text not null,
     p256dh text not null,
     auth text not null,
     created_at timestamptz default now(),
     unique(user_id, endpoint)
   );
   ```
4. **Edge Function** — Create `send-push` function using web-push library
5. **Trigger notifications** — Call Edge Function when:
   - Overdue alerts (daily check)
   - News mentions found
   - New announcements posted
   - Weekly/daily summaries
