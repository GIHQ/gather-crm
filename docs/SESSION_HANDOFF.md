## Team Management

Team members (Goldin Institute staff) are stored in the `team_members` table:
- Displayed in Directory with silver "Team" badge
- Managed via Settings > Team Management (admin+ only)
- Roles: super_admin, admin, manager, team
- Links to auth.users via user_id after first login

---

## Profile Editing

**Self-editing (My Profile in Settings):**
- Fellows and team members can edit their own profile
- Editable: phone, bio, LinkedIn, job title, organization, city, country
- Read-only: name, email (contact admin to change)

**Admin editing:**
- Admins see "Edit" button on any FellowProfileModal
- Full access to all fields including name, email, program/cohort
- Admin-only fields in violet section: program, cohort_year, alternate_emails, staff_notes
- Staff notes visible only to admins (not to the person themselves)

**Identity matching:**
- Auth flow checks both primary email and `alternate_emails` array
- See PROFILE_CLAIMING_SPEC.md for claim flow details

---

## Multiple Badges

Team members who are also fellows display multiple badges:
- Primary "Team" badge (gray-400)
- Additional program badges for each fellowship in their `fellowships` JSONB

The `getBadges()` function handles badge generation for both fellows and team members.

---

## Profile Claiming

When a user logs in with an unrecognized email:
1. **IsThisYouScreen** displays potential profile matches (parsed from email name)
2. User can claim a profile or request a new profile creation
3. Claims go into **profile_claim_requests** table with status 'pending'
4. Admins review in Team Management > Pending Claims section
5. Approved claims add the email to `alternate_emails` on the target profile
